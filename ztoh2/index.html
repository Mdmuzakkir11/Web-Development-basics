    <b><p>Why Wouldn't You Travel More When <br> There Are So Many Benefits of Traveling?!</p></b>
  </div><br>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Everyone keeps saying how important it is to travel. So what's all this fuss about? Why do people travel and love travelling?

      More importantly: why should we travel more?
      
      The benefits of traveling are not just a one-time thing: traveling changes you physically and psychologically. Having little time or money isn't a valid excuse. You can fly for cheap very easily. If you have a full-time job and a family, you can still travel on the weekends or holidays, even with a baby.
      
      2020 has been a tough year for travel - to say the least. But don't let that discourage you from making travel plans in 2021!
      
      Here are some of the main benefits of traveling, in case you need convincing. And I'm sure that once you get started, you'll find some more yourself!</p>
